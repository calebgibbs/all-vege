# all-vege 
To run this project; create a data base called 'all_vege' and import the all_vege.sql file.   
  
The users accounts all have the same password of 'password' (all lowercase)  
the admin account email is: admin@test.com  
the moderator account email is: mod@test.com  
the user account email is: user@test.com  
  
You should make a new account and log into the admin account to change your privilege (there is no need to do it though the database).
